## When Fair Ranking Meets Uncertain Inference

This repository contains the datasets and code required to reproduce the results in the SIGIR 2021 paper [When Fair Ranking Meets Uncertain Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02091) by [Avijit Ghosh](https://evijit.github.io), [Ritam Dutt](https://shorit.github.io/) and [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh).

Please refer to [SIGIR_code.ipynb](https://github.com/evijit/SIGIR_FairRanking_UncertainInference/blob/main/SIGIR_code.ipynb) for the entire code. The CHESS, ENTREPRENEURS and EQUESTRIANS folders contains the data, images and annotations for the three case studies used in the paper respectively.
